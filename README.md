## Inspiration
I have always wanted to try to do some server side coding, so I decided to make a forums.
## What it does
You can post, reply to and like questions on the forums. You can also search the questions to find what you are looking for
## How we built it
I made it as a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the client-side, and Node.js for the server-side
## Challenges I ran into
Server-side coding was a challenge for me, as I have never done it before.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of overall how it turned out
## What we learned
I learned a very basic understanding of server-side coding, and how to do that
## What's next for Code-Dev forums
Next, I might want to add a way to sort the questions based on how many likes they have.
